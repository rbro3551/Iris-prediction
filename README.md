# Iris-prediction

This is a program that uses the Iris Flowers dataset along with (primarily) scipy, sklearn, and pandas to determine the accuracy of some algorithms (LR, LDA, KNN, CART, NB, SVM) by setting up models by creating a validation dataset and setting up a test harness using 10-fold cross validation. It then builds models to predict the species of flower from the measurments. We can then choose the best model from the results. Finally, we can use that model to make the predictions. (The model used is SVM)
